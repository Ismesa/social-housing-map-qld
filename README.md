# QLD Social Housing Register Map (Beta)

This file details the specifics of our informative website – QLD Social Housing Map (Beta) (SHR). Due to rising house prices around Australia, including Queensland, the demand for public housing may increase in the near future. To prepare for such an event, or even just ease this future demand and distribution across Queensland – team Trust It Works has created this website. 

## Setup & Running Locally

SHR does not require much maintenance as the data is not updated in real-time, rather the website’s static nature acts as a small downfall because year-by-year the total number of applicants must be updated. Similarly, as Google API was used we must monitor changes to our subscription – and have alternative map APIs (e.g. Leaflet, etc.)
